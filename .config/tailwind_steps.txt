1. npm i -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

2. npx tailwindcss init -p

3. Edit tailwind.config.js and add to content to track:

base array to copy:
                     content: [
                         "./resources/**/*.blade.php",
                         "./resources/**/*.js",
                         "./resources/**/*.html",
                     ],

4. Tailwind directives must go into app.css:

                    @tailwind base;
                    @tailwind components;
                    @tailwind utilities;

5. .env APP_URL defaults to just localhost with no port?
Needs to be properly declared like for instance:

                    APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

6. Views need the following directives in <head>
for tailwind and live reload to be hooked up properly:

                     @vite('resources/js/app.js')
                     @vite('resources/css/app.css')

7. If using preexisting scaffolded views and they happen to have any <style> tags
that might contain css classes that override default TW util classes DELETE THEM
cuz they break tailwind functionality altogether.
Effing nearly an hour troubleshooting down the drain!!!
