## Custom Features and Modules

- **Custom Statusline Components:**
  ![statusline](./repo_assets/status_all.png)
  - Custom styled components for important indicators, including dynamic path formatting (shortened or full based on window width) and LSP status display with icons and client names.
  - Markdown word count display with debouncing and stripping of non-text elements like HTML tags and code blocks.
- **Specific Keymap Configurations:**
  - Keymaps organized into modules for normal, visual, insert, normal+visual, and terminal modes.
  - Filetype-specific keymaps for Lua, Markdown, Laravel, help files, Trouble, and the quickfix list.
- **Native LSP Configurations:**
  - Direct LSP configurations for various language servers (Lua, Bash, Emmet, Astro, PHPactor, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, HTML, Gopls, YAML, CSS, Harper, Docker Compose) without relying on nvim-lspconfig abstractions or intermediary setup plugins. No wrappers, just plain `vim.lsp.config()` calls. Only `mason` is used as frontend to manage package installs and retrieve their metadata.
  - Native (no plugins) diagnostics setup with specific icons, virtual text formatting (including showing the count of diagnostics on a line).
  - Autocommands adjusting certain lsp behaviors.
- **Custom Theme Implementation:**
  - Theme adapted locally from base-46 implementation of `rose-pine`.
  - Programmatic calculation and modification of colors for various highlight groups based on a base palette (things like darkening, lightening, muting, and saturating retrieved colors).
- **Modular Configuration Structure:**
  - Configuration broken down into core modules (autocommands, statusline, theme, keymaps, lsp, vim_opts) and plugin configurations.
- **AI Integrations:**
  - Supermaven for free AI completions always disabled by default, with quick keymap to toggle on/off in case help is needed. Completes via blink and uses no traditional AI ghost text to minimize flickering and code "jumping around the buffer" ðŸ˜‰
  - Aider as terminal vibing assistant, with quick toggle keymap to switch between models more appropriate for coding and for text writing ðŸ¤“
