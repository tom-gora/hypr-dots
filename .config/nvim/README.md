# My Neovim configuration

This is my private custom configuration for Neovim. No distros. Plenty of custom personal workflow enhancements. About 40 plugins and shrinking ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

## Plugins

Plugins managed by `lazy.nvim` while native package manager is still only on the roadmap:

- #### nvim-aider
  Cursor for those living in terminal.
- #### blink.cmp
  And all its dependencies providing various sources (\* Snippets setup is currently in the works).
- #### friendly-snippets
- #### LuaSnip
- #### css-vars.nvim
- #### tailwind-tools.nvim
- #### blink-copilot
- #### copilot.lua <br><br>
- #### better-escape.nvim
  `jn` to trigger &lt;Esc&gt; because I don't want to remap CapsLock system-wide and accidentally doing Escape while gaming, `jj` and `jk` too easy to hit unwillingly while navigating and `jn` is just FREE REAL ESTATE!
- #### boole.nvim
  Simpler than dial plugin. Just enough functionality for my taste.
- #### cmdline-hl.nvim
  No need to bring in entire `noice` baggage to only have nice icon indicating usage of cmdline.
- #### conform.nvim
  Formatters
- #### cutlass.nvim
  Vim heresy. Cuts are cuts and deletions go to the black hole register.
- #### gitsigns.nvim
  Git in the signcolumn.
- #### hlargs.nvim
  Highlight function arguments to immediately see where they are used.
- #### lazy.nvim
  Lazy package manager until native solution is here.
- #### lazydev.nvim
  For lua modules completions.
- #### markdown-preview.nvim
- Using fork with fixes from `Knyffen/markdown-preview.nvim` that works unlike the original package
- #### mason.nvim
- Language utilities installer.
- #### mini&period;ai, mini.move, mini.surround, nvim-highlight-colors
  A couple of useful utils from the `mini` library.
- #### nvim-treesitter
  The one and only.
- #### nvim-ts-autotag
  More webdev fluff...
- #### oklch-color-picker.nvim
  Pretty colors all around! Finally a plugin for a dirty webdev mouse-user ;)
- #### nvim-web-devicons
  Nice icons from nerdfont.
- #### oil.nvim
- The only file manager you need. Configured to show as right-hand "sidebar" split.
- #### plenary.nvim
  Everything depends on plenary. At this point why is this not core?
- #### rainbow-delimiters.nvim
  Because I like them. Also I configure base highlights with bumped up saturation for the brackets.
- #### snacks.nvim
  All-in-one. Only parts used: `bigfile`, `indent`, `lazygit`, `notifier`, `quickfile`, `terminal` and `zen` modules.
- #### text-case.nvim
  For quick toggling of text case.
- #### todo-comments.nvim
  Special purpose comment highlighter.
- #### ultimate-autopair.nvim
  It's good but every day I wonder more and more, do I really need this?
- #### vim-tmux-navigator
  Tmux pane/splits navigation
- #### which-key.nvim
  It's which-key. What else to say?
- #### nvim-silicon
  Code snippet as pretty images.
- #### quicker.nvim
  Nice (And readable!) UI for quickfix list.
- #### trouble.nvim
  For handling diagnostic errors and so and such, lsp something blah blah blah...

## Custom Features and Modules

- **Custom Statusline Components:**
  ![statusline](./repo_assets/status_all.png)
  - Custom styled components for important indicators, including dynamic path formatting (shortened or full based on window width) and LSP status display with icons and client names.
  - Markdown word count display with debouncing and stripping of non-text elements like HTML tags and code blocks.
- **Specific Keymap Configurations:**
  - Keymaps organized into modules for normal, visual, insert, normal+visual, and terminal modes.
  - Filetype-specific keymaps for Lua, Markdown, Laravel, help files, Trouble, and the quickfix list.
- **Native LSP Configurations:**
  - Direct LSP configurations for various language servers (Lua, Bash, Emmet, Astro, PHPactor, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, HTML, Gopls, YAML, CSS, Harper, Docker Compose) without relying on nvim-lspconfig abstractions or intermediary setup plugins. No wrappers, just plain `vim.lsp.config()` calls. Only `mason` is used as frontend to manage package installs and retrieve their metadata.
  - Native (no plugins) diagnostics setup with specific icons, virtual text formatting (including showing the count of diagnostics on a line).
  - Autocommands adjusting certain lsp behaviors.
- **Custom Theme Implementation:**
  - Theme adapted locally from base-46 implementation of `rose-pine`.
  - Programmatic calculation and modification of colors for various highlight groups based on a base palette (things like darkening, lightening, muting, and saturating retrieved colors).
- **Modular Configuration Structure:**
  - Configuration broken down into core modules (autocommands, statusline, theme, keymaps, lsp, vim_opts) and plugin configurations.
- **AI Integrations:**
  - Supermaven for free AI completions always disabled by default, with quick keymap to toggle on/off in case help is needed. Completes via blink and uses no traditional AI ghost text to minimize flickering and code "jumping around the buffer" ðŸ˜‰
  - Aider as terminal vibing assistant, with quick toggle keymap to switch between models more appropriate for coding and for text writing ðŸ¤“
