# My Hyprland Configuration ðŸš€

This is my custom configuration for Hyprland, a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor. This setup is designed to maximize productivity and streamline my workflow through powerful keybindings and custom scripts.

## Features and Integrations

#### A Collection of RosePine Color Adjusted Wallpapers

#### Rofi Scripts

This configuration includes several Rofi scripts that provide pickers for some quick access to various functionalities.

- **ClipManager&period;sh**: Rofi front for `cliphist` system clipboard manager to list previously copied items, enabling quick pasting of previously yanked content.

- **ColorPicker&period;sh**: A color picker to select color from the screen using `hyprpicker`. It provides various color formats (HEX, RGB, HSL, etc.) and allows to copy the selected color to the clipboard. Under the hood it uses `pastel` terminal color managament tool to convert to other color format strings and `imagemagick` to create temporary color-filled rectangle image that `rofi` uses to display picked color in the format selection part.

- **RofiShades&period;sh**: A script that generates a gradient of color shades based on a selected color using color from clipboard if present or launching a color picker first. It uses `pastel` to generate shades available at a keystroke.

- **QuickEdit&period;sh**: A Rofi menu for quick access to `hyprland` configuration files.

- **RofiBluetooth&period;sh**: A Bluetooth management script that uses `bluetoothctl` to connect and manage Bluetooth devices. Using: [LINK](https://github.com/nickclyde/rofi-bluetooth)

- **RofiEmoji&period;sh**: An emoji picker that allows to search and select emojis from a predefined list. The selected emoji is copied to the clipboard.

- **RofiSshHosts&period;sh**: An SSH host picker that allows to quickly connect to hosts defined in `~/.ssh/config`

- **Roxide&period;sh**: A script that integrates with `zoxide`, to quickly open a directory in a terminal.

- **TmuxSessions&period;sh**: A script that provides a menu for managing `tmux` sessions or create new one from `zoxide` input. It uses `sesh` as a dependency.

#### Custom Slanted-Style Waybar

#### Hyprland and SNC Notification Deamon

Hyprland's submap feature (define a binding that acts as a leader for second layer of actions after additional keypress) work together with the help of `notify-send` and some bash glue code to use notifications to display hint popups for more complex actions (acting like which-key plugins from `neovim` or `vscode`) to provide further graphical hints and nice GUI experience.

## IMPORTANT

This is very much not a distribution or a comprehensive setup. There is no claim anything will work on a system other than mine. It started waaaaay back from JaKooLit's dots [LINK](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Fedora-Hyprland) as a base but significantly evolved away from this base. The aim was to make it look, feel, and work nice for me and learn about the environment as I strip away provided fluff. It is just my personal config that I maintain for myself, however, feel free to get inspired or grab code. Remember, I do not recommend trying to comprehensively apply any of the dots willy-nilly, as those are very much specific to my machine with my hardware, installed dependencies and preferences.
